# python_ml
This a barebones implementation of machine learning concepts. It includes concepts such as:
  - linear activation
  - logistic activation
  - relu activation
  - gradient descent with a variable alpha (learning rate)
  - feature scaling utilities 
  - neural networks 
  - the ability to test the best alpha (learning rate), lambda (regularization parameter), and the degree of the polynomial used to model data.
  - helps visualize cross validation set & test set results
